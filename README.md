# Project: Identify Customer Segments
## Project Overview:

In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data used was provided by Udacity's partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represent a real-life data science task.

## Project Steps:

- Load The data
- Preprocessing (Data Cleaning & engineering)
- Feature Transformation (feature scaling and perform the PCA)
- Interpret Principal Components
- Clustering
- Compare Customer Data to Demographics Data
- Conclusion

Note: The datasets that were provided for this project are not included in this repository.
